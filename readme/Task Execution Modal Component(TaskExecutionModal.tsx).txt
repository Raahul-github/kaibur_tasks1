Task Execution Modal Component
This project implements a Task Execution Modal using React and Ant Design. It is designed to display the details of task executions in a clean and organized way, making it easy for users to track the start time, end time, and output of each task.

Overview
The modal provides a simple and interactive interface for viewing tasks. When a user opens the modal, it presents a table that lists all task executions. Each row in the table shows:
Start Time – When the task started.
End Time – When the task finished.
Output – The result of the task. If no output is available, it displays “No output” clearly.
The table is paginated, showing a limited number of entries per page to maintain readability, and it allows horizontal scrolling if the content is wider than the display area.

Features
Interactive Modal: Opens and closes smoothly, providing a focused view of task details.
Dynamic Table: Displays execution data dynamically with formatted timestamps for easy reading.
Clean Output Display: Shows task results in a code-style format, making it visually clear and professional.
Responsive Design: Supports scrolling for large datasets and limits the number of rows per page for better usability.

Usage
This component can be integrated into any React project that needs to show task execution details. It requires an array of execution objects and a visibility toggle for the modal. The design ensures that users can easily understand task timelines and outputs without any confusion.
