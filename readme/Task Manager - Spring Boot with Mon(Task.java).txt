Task Manager - Spring Boot with MongoDB
This project is a Task Manager application built using Spring Boot and MongoDB. It is designed to store and manage tasks in a structured way. Each task contains details such as its id, name, owner, and a command to be executed. Along with this, it also supports keeping track of task executions.

How It Works
The project uses MongoDB as the database to store tasks.
Each task is stored as a document inside a collection called tasks.
A task has basic information like:

id: A unique identifier for the task
name: The name of the task
owner: The person responsible for the task
command: The action or command linked with the task

In addition to these fields, the task also maintains a list of task executions, which records how the task has been executed over time.

Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show how we can build a simple backend for managing tasks using modern frameworks and databases. It demonstrates how Spring Boot integrates with MongoDB to store and retrieve data in the form of objects.

Why Itâ€™s Useful
Helps beginners understand how to model data in Java using Spring Boot
Shows how MongoDB documents can be mapped directly to Java classes
Provides a base for extending into more complex task management systems, such as automation tools or scheduling services
