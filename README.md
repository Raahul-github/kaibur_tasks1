# Task 1: Java Backend and REST API Example

This task involves implementing a Java application that provides a REST API for managing "task" objects. These task objects represent shell commands that can be executed within a Kubernetes pod.

## Task Object Structure

Each `task` object should have the following properties:

*   `id` (String): Task ID
*   `name` (String): Task name
*   `owner` (String): Task owner
*   `command` (String): Shell command to be run
*   `taskExecutions` (List<TaskExecution>): A list of task execution records.

### TaskExecution Object Structure

Each `TaskExecution` object should contain:

*   `startTime` (Date): Execution start date/time
*   `endTime` (Date): Execution end date/time
*   `output` (String): Command output

### Sample JSON Object

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "Print Hello",
  "owner": "John Smith",
  "command": "echo Hello World again!",
  "taskExecutions": [
    {
      "startTime": "2023-04-21 15:51:42.276Z",
      "endTime": "2023-04-21 15:51:43.276Z",
      "output": "Hello World!"
    },
    {
      "startTime": "2023-04-21 15:52:42.276Z",
      "endTime": "2023-04-21 15:52:43.276Z",
      "output": "Hello World again!"
    }
  ]
}
```

## REST API Endpoints

The application should expose the following REST API endpoints:

*   **GET /tasks**
    *   Returns all `task` objects if no parameters are passed.
    *   If a `task` ID is passed as a parameter, it should return a single task or a 404 Not Found error if no such task exists.

*   **PUT /tasks**
    *   Accepts a `task` object as a JSON-encoded message body.
    *   The application must validate the `command` provided in the request to ensure it does not contain unsafe or malicious code.
